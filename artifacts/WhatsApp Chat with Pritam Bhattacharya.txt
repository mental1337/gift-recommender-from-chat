8/28/17, 10:21 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Lol.. I'd recommend Murphy's automotive
8/28/17, 10:22 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: They didn't fail me for a cracked windshield
8/28/17, 10:22 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: They told me to get it replaced
8/28/17, 10:22 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Then passed me when I did that
8/28/17, 10:22 AM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: Ohk cool

8/28/17, 10:23 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Just talk to them
8/28/17, 10:23 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: You'll be fine
8/28/17, 10:23 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: But call them before going
8/28/17, 10:23 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Because they are very busy
8/28/17, 10:23 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: And you'd have to get a slot
8/28/17, 10:23 AM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: Should i tell them in advance that i have extra tint here, can u forgo it?
8/28/17, 10:24 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Well you can see what they say
8/28/17, 10:24 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: I'd not bring it up unless they do
8/28/17, 10:24 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: I'd just tell them to give me a call in case anything is not ok
8/28/17, 10:24 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Instead of failing
8/28/17, 10:24 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: They'll do that
8/28/17, 10:25 AM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: Hmm but I'm afraid that they will fail my car with a red sticker. Will they do that directly without informing me first?
8/28/17, 10:25 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Nope
8/28/17, 10:25 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: They won't do that
8/28/17, 10:25 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Tu baat karke dekh
8/28/17, 10:25 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: You'll understand
8/28/17, 10:26 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: They are quite friendly

8/31/17, 8:08 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: Lol
8/31/17, 8:08 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: So you know I've always liked spoilers
8/31/17, 8:09 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: I mean I am one of those people who actually reads the next episode's synopsis before watching it
8/31/17, 8:09 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: I think it might be because I don't really like surprises
8/31/17, 8:09 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: I like to be informed
8/31/17, 8:09 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Wbu?
8/31/17, 8:10 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: I like to be surprised
8/31/17, 8:10 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Really.. Wow
8/31/17, 8:10 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: But don't you feel uneasy?
8/31/17, 8:10 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: Coz that is the beauty of watching videos
8/31/17, 8:10 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Hmm
8/31/17, 8:10 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: It is supposed to make me feel as certain way
8/31/17, 8:10 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Right
8/31/17, 8:11 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: That's why i prefer watching anime over manga too
8/31/17, 8:11 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Right
8/31/17, 8:11 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Because you can skip to the end
8/31/17, 8:11 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: The background music, animation, voice adds a lot of effect compared to reading
8/31/17, 8:11 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: That's true
8/31/17, 8:11 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: But that is a different thing
8/31/17, 8:11 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: I mean I enjoy videos
8/31/17, 8:12 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: But the progress and story wise
8/31/17, 8:12 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: I like to be informed
8/31/17, 8:12 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: I get very anxious with surprises
8/31/17, 8:12 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: That's why I can't stand horror movies
8/31/17, 8:13 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: It's all about surprises there
8/31/17, 8:13 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Makes my anxiety sky rocket
8/31/17, 8:13 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: Yeah heh, it makes sense
8/31/17, 8:13 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: I kinda like surprised because i am not really surprised or shocked
8/31/17, 8:14 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: I think I've seen too much on the internet so I've become a bit desensitized.
8/31/17, 8:14 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Haha
8/31/17, 8:15 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: You speak as if you've seen some disturbing stuff
8/31/17, 8:15 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: Yeah lol
8/31/17, 8:15 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Really? Wow
8/31/17, 8:15 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Dark web?
8/31/17, 8:15 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: I have also hunted down disturbing movies and seen them
8/31/17, 8:15 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Or deep web?
8/31/17, 8:15 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: Not dark web yet though
8/31/17, 8:16 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Don't try that in this country
8/31/17, 8:16 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: Maybe I have seen a couple of dark web videos but not much
8/31/17, 8:16 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: I think this conversation might just get flagged for saying these things
8/31/17, 8:16 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: Heh no re
8/31/17, 8:16 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Hmm they are bad
8/31/17, 8:17 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: I don't trust these guys re.. FB will just give all the data to FBI
8/31/17, 8:17 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: Shock factors are mainly two types -
1. Scary 
2. Dirty/xxx
8/31/17, 8:17 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: Second one doesn't shock me coz of the internet
8/31/17, 8:18 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Ok
8/31/17, 8:18 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: First one doesn't shock me coz i believe in Nihilism
8/31/17, 8:18 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: What's that?
8/31/17, 8:18 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: Nihilism means everything is baseless, meaningless.
8/31/17, 8:18 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: Nothing matters
8/31/17, 8:19 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: There is no good or bad
8/31/17, 8:19 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Everything?
8/31/17, 8:19 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Hmm
8/31/17, 8:19 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: There is no moral
8/31/17, 8:19 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: No morals*
8/31/17, 8:19 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: The Joker from dark Knight is a true Nihilist imo.
8/31/17, 8:19 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Hmm... That's... I can't agree with that but I'd love to hear why you believe in that
8/31/17, 8:20 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: I thought he was an anarchist
8/31/17, 8:20 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: Nihilism goes against society
8/31/17, 8:20 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Just wanted chaos
8/31/17, 8:20 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: Yeah that too
8/31/17, 8:20 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: But i think he truly didn't care what happened
8/31/17, 8:20 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Yeah he didn't
8/31/17, 8:21 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: That's the central part of his character
8/31/17, 8:21 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: Like when he handed a pistol to Harvey and told him to shoot him,.  He wasn't playing any trick
8/31/17, 8:21 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: He's like honeybadger
8/31/17, 8:21 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: He truly didn't care
8/31/17, 8:21 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Yup
8/31/17, 8:21 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: That's true
8/31/17, 8:21 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: So for him, nothing matters
8/31/17, 8:21 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: He's just going about life doing whatever he feels like going
8/31/17, 8:21 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Hmm
8/31/17, 8:21 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: Doing*
8/31/17, 8:22 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: That is Nihilism, like animals.
8/31/17, 8:22 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: That might be great for an individual.. But as a group.. I don't think that's the best way to survive
8/31/17, 8:22 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: Exactly
8/31/17, 8:22 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Animals are very social
8/31/17, 8:23 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: They have intricate societies
8/31/17, 8:23 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Ants, bees, buffaloes, lions, fishes
8/31/17, 8:23 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: All move in packs
8/31/17, 8:24 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: Hmm yes
8/31/17, 8:24 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Very few animals are truly individualistic
8/31/17, 8:24 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: I guess not like animals
8/31/17, 8:24 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: I was imagining an isolated animal in the jungle
8/31/17, 8:25 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: But.. Now the question comes.. If so many animals in the course of their evolution decided that herd is better than one.. Then what does that say about individual survival?
8/31/17, 8:26 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: You can do whatever you want.. Without a care.. Because without your knowing you are immersed in the societal structure.. Where someone is bearing the brunt of your actions
8/31/17, 8:26 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: So... If everyone does that.. Well survival becomes a very important question
8/31/17, 8:26 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Survival of the species
8/31/17, 8:27 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: Yes
8/31/17, 8:27 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: I think I'll sleep on that thought
8/31/17, 8:27 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: Pretty sleepy
8/31/17, 8:27 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Yup
8/31/17, 8:28 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: I was gonna drive too
8/31/17, 8:28 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Gn

9/1/17, 1:22 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Ok
9/1/17, 1:22 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: I now want to resync all of them at original quality
9/1/17, 1:23 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: theres no str8 forward way to do it.
9/1/17, 1:23 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: I have to delete all the photos/videos in google photos first.
9/1/17, 1:23 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Well try changing it
9/1/17, 1:23 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: Then sync again at original quality
9/1/17, 1:23 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Hang on
9/1/17, 1:32 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: But i'm afraid to delete from google photos, because it can delete photos from the device too
9/1/17, 1:33 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Yeah.. Sorry was talking to someone else
9/1/17, 1:33 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Well.. So here's the thing
9/1/17, 1:33 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: I'd just copy all the pics to a comp on an offline folder first
9/1/17, 1:33 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Then resync it
9/1/17, 1:34 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Also.. When you change it to original resolution
9/1/17, 1:34 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: It takes up space in photos, yes.
9/1/17, 1:34 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Isn't it resyncing automatically?
9/1/17, 1:35 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: I thought it would
9/1/17, 1:35 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: Oh,.. no
9/1/17, 1:35 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: That option applies only to future photos
9/1/17, 1:35 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Oh ok
9/1/17, 1:35 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: That's why I did that from the get go
9/1/17, 1:35 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: But I'd keep an offline backup
9/1/17, 1:35 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: In case it starts deleting stuff
9/1/17, 1:36 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Also I mainly use drive for all important pics
9/1/17, 1:36 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Photos is just random stuff
9/1/17, 3:01 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Did you make it?

4/8/18, 8:52 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: yes
4/8/18, 8:52 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: wassup?
4/8/18, 8:53 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: I just realized
4/8/18, 8:53 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: You know how in maths... You have infinite numbers even within the tiniest of fraction
4/8/18, 8:53 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Through the power of decimal places
4/8/18, 8:53 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: yeah
4/8/18, 8:54 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: So.. Similarly.. Between even the smallest of moments in time... The entire time might have happened infinitely
4/8/18, 8:55 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: That's the halting problem
4/8/18, 8:55 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: yeah!
4/8/18, 8:55 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: w8 what?
4/8/18, 8:55 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Remember the halting problem?
4/8/18, 8:55 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: How you can't tell if a program is stuck or not?
4/8/18, 8:56 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: yes
4/8/18, 8:56 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: i don't understand how this is the halting problem
4/8/18, 8:57 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: So people think that as the program itself.. You cannot.. That's why you cannot code a self detector in a program that cheeks if the code is in an infinite loop or just one long instruction
4/8/18, 8:58 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: But people believe that as a bigger program.. You can
4/8/18, 8:58 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: hmm
4/8/18, 8:58 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: What if you really cannot.. Because you can then shrink this program's halt into a mere moment
4/8/18, 8:59 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Because inf.. Everything is the same
4/8/18, 8:59 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Does the value of pi contain pi?
4/8/18, 9:00 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Is the  value of pi... Recursive?
4/8/18, 9:00 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: yeah definitely
4/8/18, 9:00 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Then pi is time
4/8/18, 9:00 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Pi is infinite!
4/8/18, 9:01 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: So is that why 180 degree is pi
4/8/18, 9:01 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: It contains everything
4/8/18, 9:01 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Anything nd can be projected onto a one d
4/8/18, 9:02 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Provided the 1D is long enough
4/8/18, 9:02 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: So since 1d is infinite
4/8/18, 9:02 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: It should contain everything
4/8/18, 9:02 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: You still there?
4/8/18, 9:09 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: oh damn sorry i dozed
4/8/18, 9:09 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: No no it's fine

1/4/19, 11:51 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Did she tell you something?
1/4/19, 11:51 AM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: No, im asking her now
1/4/19, 11:51 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Ok
1/4/19, 11:51 AM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: What was it about?
1/4/19, 11:51 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: It was mainly about you and her
1/4/19, 11:51 AM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: What was the conclusion?
1/4/19, 11:51 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: About your relationship.. She wanted another person's perspective on things
1/4/19, 11:56 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Well.. I told her what I tell you essentially.. That you need to focus on:

1. what you want in life?
2. What are the things that still attract you to the other partner?
3. What were your thoughts about the other partner when you entered the marriage? 
4. Have they changed? If so, then how does that affect you?
5. All relationships are based on compromise, but you should ask if you are over-compromising at any point. Because that is not fair to both of you. For you it's obviously not fair and for the partner also because you set wrong expectations and later when you can't be like that anymore, you'll be in a worse situation.
6. Analyze all the good and bad things about the current state and keep all emotions and ego aside and decide what you want to do next. Stay/leave?
1/4/19, 11:57 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: So I told her to think along those lines
1/4/19, 11:57 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: And decide what she wants to do
1/4/19, 11:57 AM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: Ok, thanks!

1/8/19, 7:03 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: But that's ok
1/8/19, 7:03 AM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: So,... I am thinking:

If your comment/idea was not based on their gender, would our reactions be at fault for perpetuating sexist tropes, and also for judging you by assuming the worst?
1/8/19, 7:03 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: But at least they are ok with the idea
1/8/19, 7:05 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Umm.. Like I said.. People are sensitive about different things.. And I think udit and you were joking with your reactions.. But I didn't realize that she got offended
1/8/19, 7:05 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: That's why even udit didn't respond any more
1/8/19, 7:06 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: I don't think anyone is being sexist really... Just a matter of a touchy subject

1/8/19, 7:07 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: But yeah I guess it is
1/8/19, 7:07 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: I actually got the idea because in bengali weddings we actually do this.. We make the couple go through household chores
1/8/19, 7:07 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: To get them familiarized with household work
1/8/19, 7:07 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: As games

1/18/19, 1:54 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: And good
1/18/19, 1:54 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: But if you are getting a new gf.. Sorry use something else

4/26/19, 2:28 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: Dude
4/26/19, 2:29 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: That problem about climbing n stairs,... turned out to be DP.
4/26/19, 2:29 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: I thought it had a mathematical solution
4/26/19, 2:38 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Hehehe
4/26/19, 2:38 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Yeah
4/26/19, 2:38 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: Dude
4/26/19, 2:38 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: I was actually thinking a tree type solution
4/26/19, 2:39 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Where you'd have a tree kind of call back
4/26/19, 2:39 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: I was able to solve it using permutation & combination formulae, but had to apply it in each iteration, iterating for the number of 2-steps we could take
4/26/19, 2:40 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Hmm
4/26/19, 2:40 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: Number of ways to climb n stairs with n1 1-steps and n2 2-steps is:
mPm/(n1!*n2!)
where m = n1 + n2;
4/26/19, 2:40 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: mPm?
4/26/19, 2:40 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Isn't that 1?
4/26/19, 2:40 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: You meam mPn
4/26/19, 2:40 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: Since the factorial itself is linear time, the overall solution becomes
O(n^2) atleast
4/26/19, 2:40 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Acha
4/26/19, 2:41 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: actually just m! in numerator
4/26/19, 2:41 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Oh ok
4/26/19, 2:41 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: mPm is m!?
4/26/19, 2:41 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: yeah
4/26/19, 2:41 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: But turns out, DP is faster than this! O( n) overall
4/26/19, 2:41 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Man I need to revise permutations and combinations
4/26/19, 2:42 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Hmm
4/26/19, 2:42 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: And 2nd surprise,... this probably is basically fibonacci lol
4/26/19, 2:42 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: That kinda makes sense
4/26/19, 2:42 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: You have a lot of redundant computations
4/26/19, 2:43 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Lol
4/26/19, 2:43 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Hmm
4/26/19, 2:43 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Yeah
4/26/19, 2:44 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: Moreover,... fibonacci itself can be computed with a formula lol
4/26/19, 2:44 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: That just becomes O(log( n)). Didn't know this.
4/26/19, 2:44 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Oh
4/26/19, 2:44 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Hmm
4/26/19, 2:45 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: So overall, i was right that this problem has a solution by just a mathematical computation :P
Just it would take a few PhDs to figure out that fibonacci formula
4/26/19, 2:46 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Lol I'm sure it did
4/27/19, 1:33 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: So the whole wheat bread is $2 you were right
4/27/19, 1:34 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: The $1 is the normal white bread
4/27/19, 3:33 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: ah yes

7/23/19, 4:31 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: But I hope you didn't keep the money in your savings
7/23/19, 4:31 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: But now coming back to apartments,... if I have to live in a 1BHK, I'd spend $650 per month extra compared to now, i.e. 7000$ yearly
7/23/19, 4:31 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: You invested it in something right?
7/23/19, 4:32 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: How can you possibly save 20k a yr like that!?
7/23/19, 4:32 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: Well sadly only 50% of it is invested right now

7/23/19, 4:32 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: I need to do it
7/23/19, 4:32 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Hmm
7/23/19, 4:32 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: I fell off the practice of robinhood investing

7/23/19, 4:34 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: So I chose the easier way out
7/23/19, 4:34 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: I invested in a 5 year CD they call it CD here
7/23/19, 4:35 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: I'm gonna invest this year's savings for a 4 year CD
7/23/19, 4:35 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Then next year's in a 3 year
7/23/19, 4:35 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: And in 5 years I'll buy a house with the matured amount
7/23/19, 4:35 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: That's my plan
7/23/19, 4:36 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: Hmm, so you are expecting around 100k in it at the end of 5 yrs?
7/23/19, 4:36 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Yup
7/23/19, 4:37 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Should be good enough for a decent unit
7/23/19, 4:37 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: ok,.. should be more than enough to buy a house in a suburb here.
7/23/19, 4:37 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: But not for cali sadly
7/23/19, 4:37 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Here or wherever I live then

7/23/19, 4:38 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: No
7/23/19, 4:38 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: Everything is in the CD and 529?
7/23/19, 4:38 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: I just have whatever I saved this year
7/23/19, 4:38 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: So there's not much to gain for me by stealing your bank account? :P
7/23/19, 4:38 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: I keep that as emergency and then at the end of the year I move it to fixed
7/23/19, 4:38 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Lol you'd get some money
7/23/19, 4:38 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: *you'll
7/23/19, 4:39 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: The professional I hire to break into your account will probably charge more than that. :P

7/23/19, 4:39 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: True
7/23/19, 4:39 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: You'll drown.. And take me with you

7/23/19, 4:42 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Are you gonna take that 4k out?
7/23/19, 4:42 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: I was almost going to 2 months ago, but slacked off
7/23/19, 4:43 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Hmm
7/23/19, 4:43 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: And then it increased to 4k. At that time it was 2k :P
7/23/19, 4:43 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Lol
7/23/19, 4:43 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: So slacking paid off
7/23/19, 4:43 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: 😂😂
7/23/19, 4:43 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: Yeah this time

7/23/19, 4:44 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Yeah you should've cashed out
7/23/19, 4:44 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: But then you didn't know when it was gonna come down
7/23/19, 4:44 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: I was stupid to think that I should take the risk to see it grow to 100k
7/23/19, 4:44 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: No one knew
7/23/19, 4:44 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: Was trying to go big

7/23/19, 4:45 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: We'd be having a very different conversation
7/23/19, 4:46 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: But yeah see if you want to take it out and invest in something more stable
7/23/19, 4:46 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: But now I'm looking at this car instead: https://boston.craigslist.org/nos/cto/d/wakefield-2002-toyota-corolla-le/6935946355.html :/

7/23/19, 4:47 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: It's not that expensive
7/23/19, 4:47 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: Not if I have to save 20k a year
7/23/19, 4:47 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Well you can take it on a loan
7/23/19, 4:47 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: And just pay something like 500 per month or so
7/23/19, 4:48 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: yeah the monthly loan payment for it would come to 500$ instead of 250$ for my corolla
7/23/19, 4:48 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Yeah
7/23/19, 4:48 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: That's not too bad

7/23/19, 4:50 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Fascinating
7/23/19, 4:50 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: I wonder if it's universal
7/23/19, 4:50 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Like does it fit in all cars?
7/23/19, 4:51 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: I've been wanting to buy this corolla for 800$, add this unit in, stick some fancy decals on it, add some leather seat covers for 100$ and call it an awesome ride for just 1.5k!
7/23/19, 4:51 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Hmm
7/23/19, 4:51 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: yeah, physically it fits. Connectivity you'll have to check
7/23/19, 4:51 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: But you want a charger instead now?
7/23/19, 4:51 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Hmm
7/23/19, 4:52 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: yeah I want power and a luxurious roomy interior
7/23/19, 4:52 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Hmm
7/23/19, 4:53 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: Dodge Charger is the only car that fits the bill other than German luxury brands.
7/23/19, 4:53 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Is charger a 2 door car?
7/23/19, 4:53 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: And a Kia Stinger - new car from Kia,... it's awesome, but no used cars in market for cheap price since it is a new model
7/23/19, 4:53 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Or 4 door?
7/23/19, 4:53 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: no, 4 doors.
7/23/19, 4:53 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Ok
7/23/19, 4:54 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Well I think if you want one.. Go for it.. It's not that expensive to be honest
7/23/19, 4:55 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Your excise tax will increase thin
7/23/19, 4:55 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: *though

7/23/19, 4:57 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Well it?
7/23/19, 4:57 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: I think gas might be similar
7/23/19, 4:57 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: I think highway is the only place where you really save in these cars
7/23/19, 4:57 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: City driving wise all are similar
7/23/19, 4:58 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Aren't they?
7/23/19, 5:01 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: well it has a bigger engine, so it had lower mpg for both city and highway
7/23/19, 5:01 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Oh hmm

7/27/19, 5:44 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: How much house do u think can afford right now?
7/27/19, 5:44 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: None
7/27/19, 5:44 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: Ive been spending too much time on researching hosues and finances
7/27/19, 5:44 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: All my savings are locked up
7/27/19, 5:44 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Hehe I can see that
7/27/19, 5:44 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: Assuming u are able to pull them out
7/27/19, 5:45 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: And I have figured out 3 criteria -
7/27/19, 5:45 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Still won't be able to afford anything decent
7/27/19, 5:45 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Ok
7/27/19, 5:46 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: 1. How costly a house I can afford now? (or with a certain available downpayment)
2. How costly a house is profitable to own instead of renting, for 5 yrs?
7/27/19, 5:46 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: 3. I forgot what the 3rd one was
7/27/19, 5:46 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Lol
7/27/19, 5:47 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: These are good questions
7/27/19, 5:47 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: Available cash for downpayment is the biggest restricting factor
7/27/19, 5:47 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Hmm
7/27/19, 5:47 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: 3. How costly a house I can afford with my wife living together and earning the same.
7/27/19, 5:47 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Right
7/27/19, 5:48 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: So turns out,.. living individually, it is profitable to own a house that costs only 160k or less.
7/27/19, 5:49 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Really?
7/27/19, 5:49 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: How so?
7/27/19, 5:49 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: And, provided one has the downpayment, to maintain the current lifestyle (expenses), individually I can afford a 400k house.
7/27/19, 5:50 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: The down payment is 20% usually right?
7/27/19, 5:51 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: yes
7/27/19, 5:51 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Hmm
7/27/19, 5:51 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: You could take a look at some condos
7/27/19, 5:52 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: I considered that the monthly payment ( mortgage+taxes etc) should be <= rent if living individually (~$1400)
7/27/19, 5:52 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Hmm
7/27/19, 5:52 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: But you should also factor the maintenance
7/27/19, 5:52 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: For this, I'd have to pay $2800 monthly
7/27/19, 5:53 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Yup
7/27/19, 5:53 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Also.. There's one thing though..
7/27/19, 5:53 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: If you are currently saving up for a house
7/27/19, 5:53 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Say you want to save $500 per month
7/27/19, 5:53 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Then your calculation should include that
7/27/19, 5:54 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: Yeah ive included that
7/27/19, 5:54 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Monthly expense after buying house <= rent + saving
7/27/19, 5:55 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: Basically, (whatever I am saving right now + current rent) is what I can afford to pay per month
7/27/19, 5:55 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Hmm
7/27/19, 5:55 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: keeping aside about 500$ for general saving
7/27/19, 5:55 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: If you are breaking even in that sense then why not buy a house if you can afford it
7/27/19, 5:55 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: So, basically, right now we can all indvidually afford to own a 400k house!! *if we had 80k cash!*
7/27/19, 5:56 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Yeah that 80k is the problem
7/27/19, 5:56 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Also you'll have a realtor fee which is usually 6% I think
7/27/19, 5:56 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: Alternatively, we can pay 10% downpayment and pay around 200$ per month for mortgage insurance.
7/27/19, 5:56 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: It's either 3 or 6
7/27/19, 5:57 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Hmm
7/27/19, 5:57 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Some people take loan for the down payment
7/27/19, 5:57 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: OR, if 4 of us pool in money for downpayment, we can afford a great mansion and also be able to pay off the loan quickly!
7/27/19, 5:58 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Lol true but it won't be your house
7/27/19, 6:00 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: Hmm
7/27/19, 6:00 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: It'll be an investment
7/27/19, 6:00 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Not your alone
7/27/19, 6:00 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: But I guess the problem comes when we want to sell our share
7/27/19, 6:00 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: Who would buy?
7/27/19, 6:00 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Yup
7/27/19, 6:00 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Investments like that are very complex
7/27/19, 6:00 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: yeah
7/27/19, 6:01 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: And best avoided
7/27/19, 6:02 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: I guess it would be suited for polygamous folks - 3 or 4 of them living together :P
7/27/19, 6:03 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Lol if that's legal
7/27/19, 6:03 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: And if all of them are working
7/27/19, 6:03 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Sure
7/29/19, 6:45 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Hey I had a little chat with Mrudula today about your situation. From what she tells me you guys are still not in a good spot
7/29/19, 6:46 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Let me know sometime after your assignment is done
7/29/19, 6:46 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: We can talk
7/29/19, 6:52 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: sure
7/29/19, 6:53 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: will have to be tomorrow
7/29/19, 6:53 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Ok
7/30/19, 10:50 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Hey so Mrudula said that she's fine with you seeing the texts. Do you want me to forward them to you as screenshots?
7/30/19, 10:56 AM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: Okay yeah
7/30/19, 10:56 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: One sec then
7/30/19, 10:56 AM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: What do you want to convey via them though?
7/30/19, 10:58 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Let me try to phrase this right.
7/30/19, 10:58 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: I have spoken to het
7/30/19, 10:58 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: *her
7/30/19, 10:58 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: And now I want to speak with you on the same page
7/30/19, 10:58 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Want to know what you think about it

7/30/19, 11:08 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: <Media omitted>
7/30/19, 11:08 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: So as I said earlier.. The reason why I'm sharing this with you is because I wanted to chat with you along these lines
7/30/19, 11:09 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Like what do you think? I've heard her side.. I want to hear your side
7/30/19, 11:27 AM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: Just finished going through the chats
7/30/19, 11:27 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Hmm
7/30/19, 11:43 AM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: So... previously 3 yrs ago (before marrying), I had wanted to break up with her, but never could. She isn't really my type, moderately so, so I used to feel I could do better, I should date more, etc. But I never could break up, either because I was a coward, or I just dont know how to deal with breakups.

Now, I feel like I am out of time to try to get a better partner (and I am), so it's like she is the best partner I can get, and she is good enough. Now and then when some of her behavioural or physical turn offs kick in, I think to myself "Told you, this might be a problem, I should have tried to date more 3-4 yrs ago".

She actually a really good-hearted person with enough enthusiasm in life, and other matching thigns between us; so I really have always wanted for it to work between us. But some of her nature points always kept being a turn off making me focus on her physical aspects (I think to myself: "I started dating her not for the looks but for her intellect, but now it seems neither is sufficiently there"). So I tried to change her all these years, and I believe rightly so because she also acknowledgd that it would be right to change those aspects. (eg. if you are getting fussy over tiny issues all the time, it is universally agreed upon that it is better to change it).

Those changes came too late - when she talked to a therapist in 2017 and finally showed some improvements. By that time all her other flaws had become too prominent in my head. And living apart did not allow any of the good aspects of her (old or new aspects) to overshadow her flaws.
7/30/19, 11:47 AM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: I am unsure of how many of our past issues are actualyl resolved
7/30/19, 11:48 AM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: like how she mentioned the seemingly minor issue of me wanting to be a career man, not at all a family man.
7/30/19, 11:49 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Hmm I understand. That makes sense. But I would like to ask you the same things I asked her.. 
1. Do you see yourself raising a family with her?
2. What will it take for you to accept her?
3. Do you think she'll accept you?
4. I understand moving together is a problem right now. But say if you can in the next year.. Are you both willing to wait till then and then move together?
7/30/19, 11:49 AM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: side note: I never said I would outright decline to go for a kid's event instead of work,... I had said it depends on the priority, it depends on the situation. 
So overall, I think we 2 are still not on the same page about it,... she doesnt understand that such things dont have a clear black/white answer. It depends.
7/30/19, 11:50 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: So from what I am hearing there's still a communication gap between the two of you
7/30/19, 11:50 AM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: yeah
7/30/19, 11:50 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: That brings me to my questions..
7/30/19, 11:50 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: What do you think?
7/30/19, 11:50 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Because if you don't see a future
7/30/19, 11:50 AM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: I think there is a BIG communication gap due to not living closeby, not interacting physically.
7/30/19, 11:50 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: There's no point
7/30/19, 11:51 AM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: And I dont think she understands that there is a big communication gap
7/30/19, 11:51 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Dekh.. I know of a teammate who used to go to Atlanta every weekend because his wife was in Atlanta
7/30/19, 11:52 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Why don't you both try to do something similar?
7/30/19, 11:52 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Meet more frequently
7/30/19, 11:52 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: It'll be expensive
7/30/19, 11:52 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: But if it can save your marriage...
7/30/19, 11:52 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Also idk how flexible your team is..
7/30/19, 11:52 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: You could probably pull in a week every month as wfh
7/30/19, 11:52 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Where you go to cali and work from there
7/30/19, 11:53 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: She could do something similar as well
7/30/19, 11:54 AM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: Coast to coast is tooo expensive to do so frequently! Not just money-wise but also time-wise... like I'll have no life beyond just doing that.
7/30/19, 11:54 AM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: But we did try
7/30/19, 11:54 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: I agree.. But I'd say this is important enough for that isn't it?
7/30/19, 11:54 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: You did?
7/30/19, 11:54 AM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: We had decided to meet atleast 4 times a yr, and we did more than that often
7/30/19, 11:54 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: 4 is too less re.
7/30/19, 11:55 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: That too in a year!
7/30/19, 11:55 AM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: yeah,.. it is,... but
7/30/19, 11:55 AM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: It didnt seem possible with the work, study and costs
7/30/19, 11:56 AM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: Anyway coming to these points
7/30/19, 11:56 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Hmm
7/30/19, 11:58 AM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: like, in 2016, 2017, every long weekend used to be booked for our trip. I wanted my to relax, catch up on work, do some project,... that is what I needed to do to improve myself, but couldn't.
Hanging out with each other best happens spontaneously like how we hang out randomly. It isn't the same. If it is planned, it just turns into a trip, going to some park, outing etc.
7/30/19, 12:00 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: It doesnt help. What was necessary was for her to come here for 1-2 months at a stretch working from home.
7/30/19, 12:00 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: I gtg for a meeting right now
7/30/19, 12:00 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Yeah me too
7/30/19, 12:00 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Let's talk later
7/31/19, 4:44 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: hey
7/31/19, 4:44 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: I do want to talk to you about the above questions and the topic in general
7/31/19, 4:45 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: I'll talk to you tomorrow though, planning to still recover sleep and get a little satisfaction of reading a chapter

1/29/20, 3:41 AM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: Hey after receiving WES credential assessment, for filing the Express Entry form, do you have to physically mail the WES ECA?
1/29/20, 3:41 AM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: Do you have to physically mail anything for the Express Entry form?
1/29/20, 3:42 AM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: My WES is still in process, they updated status yesterday saying they will be done on feb 25. I'll be in India at that time. My bdate is 13th mar, so I need to file the Express Entry form before that.
1/29/20, 5:05 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: I didn't have to
1/29/20, 5:05 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Only scanned copy
1/29/20, 5:07 AM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: hmm
1/31/20, 8:04 AM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: Hey
1/31/20, 8:05 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Sup
1/31/20, 8:05 AM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: Weird question
1/31/20, 8:05 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Go on
1/31/20, 8:05 AM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: How many times in a day do you think of sex or something related to sex?
1/31/20, 8:05 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Lol depends on how bored I am
1/31/20, 8:06 AM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: Try to answer accurately,... how many times in an hour?
1/31/20, 8:06 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: I usually think of it when I'm bored
1/31/20, 8:06 AM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: say on a saturday
1/31/20, 8:06 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Well again if I'm bored and at home.. I'll be thinking about it a lot
1/31/20, 8:06 AM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: On a saturday when you're not meeting anyone. You're at home.
1/31/20, 8:07 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: I have mastubated 6 times in a day
1/31/20, 8:07 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: So if that's any indication
1/31/20, 8:07 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: ...
1/31/20, 8:07 AM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: lol thats cool, but that must be an outlier.
1/31/20, 8:07 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Outlier?
1/31/20, 8:07 AM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: I end up thinking about it a lot over a weekend
1/31/20, 8:07 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Yeah that's natural
1/31/20, 8:08 AM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: i mean,.. that's not the average is it?
1/31/20, 8:08 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: No that's extreme boredom
1/31/20, 8:08 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Usually over the weekends... Maybe 1 or 2 times a day
1/31/20, 8:09 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Mostly just before sleeping
1/31/20, 8:09 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Because that's when I stop thinking about everything else
1/31/20, 8:09 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: And try to relax
1/31/20, 8:09 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: And that's the easiest way to relax
1/31/20, 8:10 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: I think it's fine.. Apparently at this age men are quite horny.. And our sex drive goes down as we age
1/31/20, 8:10 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: It's the reverse for girls apparently
1/31/20, 8:10 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: From what I've heard
1/31/20, 8:52 AM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: <Media omitted>
1/31/20, 10:03 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Cool
2/12/20, 7:25 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: Hey
2/12/20, 7:26 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: I have a weird question
2/12/20, 7:26 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Sup
2/12/20, 7:26 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Go on
2/12/20, 7:26 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: When you stand straight up, straight posture, straight neck, and then look down by your neck without moving your neck forward, ... can you see your p***s? :P :P
2/12/20, 7:26 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: If you havent tried it, let me know next time
2/12/20, 7:26 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: If I don't pull my belly back.. No
2/12/20, 7:27 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: hmm ok
2/12/20, 7:27 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: I'm quite fat
2/12/20, 7:27 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: I can't either :(
2/12/20, 7:27 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: I'm skinny fat now
2/12/20, 7:27 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: So you got company in losing weight :)
2/12/20, 7:27 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Oh maybe your posture isn't straight?
2/12/20, 7:27 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Lol good to know
2/12/20, 7:27 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: no no,... i have a legit belly.
2/12/20, 7:28 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Hmm
2/12/20, 7:29 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Yeah let's try to reduce
2/12/20, 7:32 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: When u diet, do u feel hungry?
2/12/20, 7:33 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Yes. But last time I tried a diet.. The hunger pang was there for the first few weeks then I got used to it
2/12/20, 7:33 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: oh
2/12/20, 7:33 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: For the first few days, do u feel hungry at night?
2/12/20, 7:33 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: Didnt it bother u for sleeping?
2/12/20, 7:33 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Not days.. Weeks bro
2/12/20, 7:33 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Yes
2/12/20, 7:33 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: Hmm, ok... so is that how it is supposed to be?
2/12/20, 7:34 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: I ask because...
2/12/20, 7:34 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: It did that's why I tried to either make myself super tired or distract by watching or reading something
2/12/20, 7:34 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: I think it's supposed to be that way.. You get used to it slowly
2/12/20, 7:35 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: I ask because according to online suggestions, I should be eating Y = (X-300 cals) for a slight deficit in cals to lose weight. But even if I eat just that Y amount, I still dont feel hungry,.. it's almost like my regular diet.
2/12/20, 7:36 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Well you do eat less
2/12/20, 7:36 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: So now I think the online suggestions dont apply to my body
2/12/20, 7:36 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Also it depends on your metabolism
2/12/20, 7:36 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: You might have a slow one
2/12/20, 7:36 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Keeps you fuller for long
2/12/20, 7:36 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: yeah,.. the online ones probably take an average over typical american males or something
2/12/20, 7:36 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Yeah
2/12/20, 7:36 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Your normal diet is actually quite less
2/12/20, 7:37 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: I told you this in the past as well
2/12/20, 7:37 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: So you do have an advantage on that front
2/12/20, 7:37 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: You might have a slow metabolism
2/12/20, 7:37 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: That's helpful for losing weight
2/12/20, 7:38 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Keeps you full for long with lesser amount of food
2/12/20, 8:04 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: I read up a bit on keto diet.
2/12/20, 8:04 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: I think I'll do it too
2/12/20, 8:04 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: How do u plan on doing it though?
2/12/20, 8:04 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: The amount of carbs is incredibly low!!!!!
2/12/20, 8:04 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Well I honestly don't know
2/12/20, 8:04 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Yeah I've heard
2/12/20, 8:05 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: I'll have to cook everyday for sure
2/12/20, 8:05 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: And lots of salad
2/12/20, 8:05 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: But yeah I'll start reading up on it when I get back
2/12/20, 8:06 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: It says less than 50 grams of carbs every day
2/12/20, 8:06 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Well my friend said less than 30
2/12/20, 8:06 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: So i think homemade food isn't gonna be useful.
2/12/20, 8:06 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: It's gotta be just leafy veggies, and some kind of fats
2/12/20, 8:06 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: and proteins
2/12/20, 8:06 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Well depends on what you're cooking
2/12/20, 8:06 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Yes
2/12/20, 8:07 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: That's what you'll have to cook
2/12/20, 8:07 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: What would u cook for htis?

2/12/20, 8:25 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: no no, thats for me. I reduced it down further.
2/12/20, 8:26 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: coz yesterday, I was just fine with 1200 cals. Today I had 1400 cals and im full lol
2/12/20, 8:26 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Dude that's half of what you should have normally
2/12/20, 8:26 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: nah, normally i should be having 1800 for maintaining weight
2/12/20, 8:26 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: according to online sources
2/12/20, 8:27 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Interesting
2/12/20, 8:27 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: That's still low
2/12/20, 8:27 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: 1800 for me would be cutting down
2/12/20, 8:27 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: <Media omitted>

2/28/20, 7:56 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: I'll have to see if they'll fit though
2/28/20, 7:57 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: Its okay

2/28/20, 7:58 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Well idk how much I trust others
2/28/20, 7:58 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: That's why I created my own server

6/29/20, 4:15 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: I am wondering if I should buy a motherboard that has a 10GBps ethernet interface

7/4/20, 3:33 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: Would have been either cheaper by getting just a 2 bay Synology, or more expandable in the future right?
7/4/20, 3:34 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: I wanted to stick to WD
7/4/20, 3:34 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: And I think at that time 8TB wasn't available

2/5/21, 12:44 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: To be honest I'm not too much a fan of buying new cars
2/5/21, 12:44 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: I would always go for certified pre-owned
2/5/21, 12:45 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: But my budget would be... Maybe max $35k
2/5/21, 12:47 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: <Media omitted>

2/5/21, 8:54 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Yes
2/5/21, 8:55 AM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: Price + repair/maintenance costs
2/5/21, 8:55 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: So.. The first one I spent a lot because of being an idiot and sentimental
2/5/21, 8:55 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: I spend total almost $7k on my first car

2/5/21, 8:56 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Including purchase and repairs
2/5/21, 8:56 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: But to be honest that's mostly because we did the repairs ourselves
2/5/21, 8:57 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: And none of the two is a certified pre-owned
2/5/21, 8:57 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Certified pre-owned ones aren't this expensive to maintain
2/5/21, 8:57 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: You get good card that are only a few years old with about 50k miles

2/5/21, 9:00 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Be careful with this
2/5/21, 9:00 AM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: Because owning an electric car as the sole car is a hassle when you are living an unsettled life in an apartment
2/5/21, 9:00 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: I'd be careful with used cars that aren't jap or Korean
2/5/21, 9:01 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Hmm true
2/5/21, 9:01 AM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: Have to rely on public charging, mathworks charging. When i move out of mathworks, then another hassle
2/5/21, 9:01 AM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: Going on long road trips is a hassle
2/5/21, 9:01 AM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: And it's not cheap either,.. even Model 3 comes to 60k with the future self driving capability and taxes
2/5/21, 9:02 AM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: And their supercharging price is close to gas prices of MA
2/5/21, 9:02 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Acha
2/5/21, 9:03 AM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: And tesla model 3 on the inside looks very barebones. It literally has nothing other than a huge touchscreen. Even steering wheel controls are scarce
2/5/21, 9:03 AM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: At what point does a car become a money pit?

7/27/21, 9:12 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Almost too good
7/27/21, 9:12 AM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: I'll be delaying it obviously until about next yr
7/27/21, 9:12 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Oh why?
7/27/21, 9:13 AM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: Im not jumping into buying a house now,..
7/27/21, 9:13 AM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: Gonna rent an apartment on west bay first
7/27/21, 9:13 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Ok
7/27/21, 9:13 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Hmm
7/27/21, 9:13 AM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: Also, this house will be gone in a week for sure.
7/27/21, 9:13 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: But yeah this was an amazing listing
7/27/21, 9:13 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Everything was good
7/27/21, 9:13 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: I’d say a few days for sure
7/27/21, 9:13 AM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: Good to know that I didnt miss seeing any problems
7/27/21, 9:13 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Yeah
7/27/21, 11:30 AM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: Did u consider living in NJ over massachusetts?
7/27/21, 12:02 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Well I am not a fan of nyc
7/27/21, 12:02 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: And the only happening thing there is nyc
7/27/21, 12:02 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: I like Boston culture much better
7/27/21, 12:03 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: hmm
7/27/21, 12:03 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: And why not New Hampshire, on the border of Mass?
7/27/21, 12:04 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: no income tax, no sales tax.
7/27/21, 12:04 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: Equally close to AMD office
7/27/21, 12:04 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Well won’t get the same quality schools there
7/27/21, 12:04 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: hmm
7/27/21, 12:05 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: And Anannya kinda didn’t want to lose the convenience of route 9
7/27/21, 12:05 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Have a good community
7/27/21, 12:06 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: And we both want to be in suburbs
7/27/21, 12:06 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Kinda like wanna live near a city but not in it
7/27/21, 12:06 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: So this area checked out
7/27/21, 12:06 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Honestly Ashland was not our top preference
7/27/21, 12:07 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Our top preference was Shrewsbury or Northborough or Westborough
7/27/21, 12:07 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: But yeah you can say we kinda decided on Ashland as a compromise
7/27/21, 12:08 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: Yeah that is a big factor
7/27/21, 12:08 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: I rather think Ashland is best of these, better than framingham
7/27/21, 12:08 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Yeah this has a good desi community, average schools, decently close to shops and Boston
7/27/21, 12:08 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: Much greenery, good schools, close to framingham/natick, not too far from boston
7/27/21, 12:09 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: We never wanted Framingham because of high crime rate
7/27/21, 12:09 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: Shrewsburry will be too far and too desi
7/27/21, 12:09 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Yeah but the location is brilliant because if we buy a house there we don’t need to change ever potentially
7/27/21, 12:10 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Because it has great schools
7/27/21, 12:10 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Now with the Ashland place we know that we might have to change when our kids grow
7/27/21, 12:10 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Because elementary and high schools aren’t super
7/27/21, 12:11 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: And they are not too far from Boston. You don’t really go to Boston everyday and when you need to it’s within an hour drive
7/27/21, 12:12 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Which is doable
7/27/21, 12:12 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: Thats a good thing. Switching to a different house after 5+ yrs will be very easy financially by leveraging the value of this house.
7/27/21, 12:12 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: You are assuming house prices will go up and you are not factoring in the hassle of moving
7/27/21, 12:12 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: And you wouldnt want to anchor yourself to one place forwever,.. will be boring
7/27/21, 12:13 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: Bruh, just hire some movers then, one time spending of 2k will get everything done
7/27/21, 12:13 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Well so that depends on individual.. we both have been traveling all our lives and we kinda like the idea of anchoring
7/27/21, 12:13 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: hmm yeah
7/27/21, 12:13 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: So for us anchoring is desirable
7/27/21, 12:14 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: But you’re right that might not be for everyone
7/27/21, 12:15 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: We love to travel but only for touring.. not living
7/27/21, 12:15 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: I also mean it in the sense that it is easier to start with a starter home for 5 yrs then move into a bigger/expensive one. That's what people generally do.
7/27/21, 12:15 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Yeah that’s what we will have to do as well
7/27/21, 12:15 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: But I’d have loved to avoid that
7/27/21, 12:15 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: That’s all
7/27/21, 12:15 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: As opposed to trying to jump into a million dollar home lol
7/27/21, 12:16 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Lol well yeah I doubt after 5-6 years we would jump into million $ home 😅
7/27/21, 12:16 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Even then we would probably get decent ones in mass under a mill
7/27/21, 12:17 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: One thing is kinda for sure between the two of us.. we don’t want to move out of mass
7/27/21, 12:17 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: And preferably stay in good school districts in mass
7/27/21, 12:18 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Another big reason for staying in mass is that there are a lot of brilliant colleges here
7/27/21, 12:18 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: And by being a resident here.. we’ll get instate tuition fees which we’ll really need
7/27/21, 12:19 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: yeah thats great
7/27/21, 12:19 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: Mass is superb for growing kids
7/27/21, 12:19 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: Maybe I'll return to Mass after a few yrs
7/27/21, 12:20 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: I just need a million dollars first to get a green card
7/27/21, 12:20 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: My sister’s daughter had such issues while college hunting because even though she could get in a med school in mass they couldn’t afford out of state tuition
7/27/21, 12:20 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: lol
7/27/21, 12:20 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Investor route?
7/27/21, 12:20 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: Yeah,.. thats the only hope remaining
7/27/21, 12:20 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: True
7/27/21, 12:21 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: I’ve kinda given up on that
7/27/21, 12:21 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: I guess it will be a race to whether your kid will turn 18 & sponsor you, or whether you'll save 1m cash
7/27/21, 12:21 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Hmm
7/27/21, 12:22 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: I’ll just go back worst case.. be like see ya! Give my 401k money.. go back.. live like king
7/27/21, 2:20 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: Although maps show higher crime rate in Framingham, having lived here, it never felt unsafe though.
7/27/21, 2:23 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Well Framingham is big area
7/27/21, 2:23 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: It has two postal codes
7/27/21, 2:23 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Some parts are not good
7/27/21, 2:24 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: That brings the whole area’s crime rate average up
7/28/21, 6:14 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: Hey
7/28/21, 6:15 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: What would make a multimillionaire fund my investment-based green card?
7/28/21, 6:15 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: (And yours)
7/28/21, 6:52 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Not sure
7/28/21, 6:52 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: I haven’t really looked into that
7/28/21, 6:58 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: I mean, what do multi-millionnaires really do with more money? They would be capable of giving an interest-free million dollar loan to someone like you and me.
7/28/21, 6:58 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: I think for investor visa you need to show that you have created jobs
7/28/21, 6:58 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: And provided employment to local us citizens
7/28/21, 6:59 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: Assume that there exists an opportunity wherein if I simply furnish a million dollars to a middle-man agency, I will be on track to get a GC (legally)
7/28/21, 6:59 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Oh
7/28/21, 6:59 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: (There does exist such a thing really!)
7/28/21, 6:59 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: I didn’t know that
7/28/21, 6:59 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Hmm
7/28/21, 6:59 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: That’s interesting
7/28/21, 6:59 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: :)
7/28/21, 7:00 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: It is interesting
7/28/21, 7:00 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: Just need some $$ :P
7/28/21, 7:00 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: What if that middle man is your child?
7/28/21, 7:00 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Or a trust on the name of your child?
7/28/21, 7:00 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: *in
7/28/21, 7:01 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: No no,.. u didnt get it,.. there exist agencies which do the project work of creating jobs (indirectly), they just need capital from an investor who would then get the GC.
7/28/21, 7:01 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Acha
7/28/21, 7:01 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Ok
7/28/21, 7:02 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: So you donate it?
7/28/21, 7:02 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: Basically, if I had a million dollars now, I could transfer that money to the agency, they would do all the work, I would get the GC
7/28/21, 7:02 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Do you get any returns?
7/28/21, 7:02 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: And that million dollars is not a donation,.. I would get it back after about 5 years, but generally negligible returns
7/28/21, 7:02 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Ok
7/28/21, 7:02 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Interesting
7/28/21, 7:03 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: What if that million $ came from a loan?
7/28/21, 7:03 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: So basically I just need a million dollars of personal loan without any interest.
7/28/21, 7:03 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: Who would give it to me?
7/28/21, 7:03 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Hm
7/28/21, 7:03 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: That is allowed legally.
7/28/21, 7:03 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Yeah that’s the hard part
7/28/21, 7:04 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: Correct,.. that's the tricky part Im trying to crack :P
Crack this, and you'll get a GC
7/28/21, 7:04 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: But please tell me too :D
7/28/21, 7:04 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: And dont tell more people, or else the backlog in EB5 will build up rapidly LOL

8/13/21, 6:56 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Oh how do you use magnets?

8/13/21, 7:20 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: Ok that's good
8/13/21, 7:20 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: If the magnet sticks to the wall then there's a stud in there
8/13/21, 7:20 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: Short of a powerful magnet, you'll have to buy a stud finder
8/13/21, 7:39 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Yeah I have two of those and they are extremely unreliable on my wall

8/27/21, 12:51 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: We actually had planned a trip over the long weekend.. but canceled everything
8/27/21, 12:51 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: You have to face the risk of falling sick with something or the other
8/27/21, 12:51 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: Before the vaccine, yes it was scary
8/27/21, 12:51 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Can’t take chances bro.. Anannya is asthmatic
8/27/21, 12:51 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: She was having breathing issues even a few days back

8/27/21, 12:53 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Non asthmatic patients go on ventilators
8/27/21, 12:53 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Imagine what it does to these people

8/27/21, 12:56 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Sorry but I’m really scared about the delta numbers in Cali
8/27/21, 12:56 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: What kind of protections or healthcare would be needed for asthma patients to face exposure to covid?

8/27/21, 12:58 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: You can take the standard precautions and hope for the best
8/27/21, 12:59 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Also I think you should be a little more cautious bro… there are breakthrough cases… just don’t get completely relaxed

8/27/21, 1:01 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: And then stay indoors when they climb again
8/27/21, 1:01 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Yup
8/27/21, 1:02 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: But that's a huge lifestyle change

8/27/21, 1:03 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: I’m just so annoyed at the unvaccinated crowd
8/27/21, 1:03 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: This is happening all because of them

12/6/21, 9:58 AM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: Hey, can you make a call to Sen Durbin's office regarding the immigration provisions? It's really important to have a high call volume showing support for these provisions and asking Durbin to work on them in good faith; that is our only way to add pressure and hold him accountable. New unique callers are crucial.  Most Indians don't end up calling because of the bystander effect ("others will do it"). The telegram group that is coordinating effort keeps track of number of calls and it really is low. We literally *need* more people to call (daily). So can you and Ananya make one can each to Durbin's office?
12/6/21, 9:58 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Sure
12/6/21, 9:59 AM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: Here's the forwarded message from the Telegram group bit.ly/EB-GC-ADVOCACY

7/26/22, 9:44 AM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: So you just enter the address at the airport security?
7/26/22, 9:44 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Yup
7/26/22, 9:44 AM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: No interview?

7/26/22, 9:47 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Slots opened up???
7/26/22, 9:47 AM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: Bruh so much hassle!!!
7/26/22, 9:48 AM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: They open up slots at random times in the week
7/26/22, 9:48 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Whaaa
7/26/22, 9:48 AM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: But there's a telegram group that knows the time pattern
7/26/22, 9:48 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Did you just keep refreshing?
7/26/22, 9:48 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Oh
7/26/22, 9:49 AM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: But you can only login 4 times a day, and you can only check appts 12 times a day or else the website bans you
7/26/22, 9:49 AM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: So then you keep an eye on others sharing info
7/26/22, 9:50 AM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: CheckVisaSlots.com has an alert system got a subscription fee
7/26/22, 9:50 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Really??
7/26/22, 9:50 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Omg

7/26/22, 9:50 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: It’s like the scarcity is fueling a whole business ecosystem
7/26/22, 9:51 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: I’m gonna say because they can
7/26/22, 9:51 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: They are just heartless
7/26/22, 9:51 AM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: But ofcourse everyone's following it so you have to rush within a minute
7/26/22, 9:51 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Hmm
7/26/22, 9:51 AM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: There are agents in India who say they will get you a slot quickly
7/26/22, 9:52 AM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: They charge about rs.30k to rs.50k!
7/26/22, 9:52 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Damn just to get appointments?
7/26/22, 9:53 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: This is so messed up
7/26/22, 9:53 AM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: Some Indians here went thru the agent so they gave me reference. I was gonna use but got mine luckily thru checkvisaslots alert
7/26/22, 9:53 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Ok
7/26/22, 9:53 AM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: Yeah... And it's actually not allowed. Because u have to give them your account access which has all your passport details
7/26/22, 9:53 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Hmm that’s scary
7/26/22, 9:54 AM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: So basically the agents have access to hundreds or thousands of accounts, so they probably have workers checking every minute
7/26/22, 9:55 AM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: If you need to book yours, let me know
7/26/22, 10:04 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Yup! Not mine but I was thinking if I could prepone anannya’s appointment that would be better for her

7/29/22, 10:47 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: At least that’s what I’ve heard

7/29/22, 10:48 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: No no it's still valid...

1/1/25, 8:07 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: Hey what is the training details that you took for interview prep?
1/1/25, 8:07 PM - Pritam Bhattacharya: And how much did it cost?
1/2/25, 12:48 AM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: Hey, yeah it was called Interview Kickstart
1/2/25, 12:50 AM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: They charged 6k back then. It is about 3 months of structured preparation, and then they give 6 months of access to Q&A sessions for support.
1/2/25, 12:53 AM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: I liked it. It is well structured. The content can technically be studied from various sources like formal algo courses, leetcode solutions etc, but this provides a good structure. 
Also, the teaching & explanations given by some of their instructors is really helpful.
1/2/25, 12:54 AM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: I have a referral link if you want to enroll, might get some fee off
1/2/25, 12:55 AM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: Also, you get access to a community of people preparing for coding interviews seriously and good industry connections
1/2/25, 5:03 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: I see. I was actually thinking for my brother
1/2/25, 5:03 AM - Pritam Bhattacharya: But 6k is a bit too much re
1/2/25, 12:34 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: Yeah 6k is a lot. I was hesitant too
1/2/25, 12:36 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: Their value proposition is that if it helps you get a job with higher pay it is worth it; They also help with soft skills & interview negotiation.
Oh and I forgot, system design is also part of it apart from DS&Algo
1/2/25, 12:37 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: Maybe it is better suited for mid level engineers like us looking to level up.

What does your brother do?
1/2/25, 12:37 PM - 𝔖𝔞𝔤𝔞𝔯: https://neetcode.io/
This seems like a good resource for entry level interviews
